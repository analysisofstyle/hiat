<h2>Why Researching Hiatus Avoidance?</h2>
<br>
Whether or not hiatus, i.e. the encounter of two vowels at a word boundary, 
is allowed without restriction in an ancient prose text is of interest in multiple regards since it can: 
- reveal forgeries or interpolations for the sake of evaluating the authenticity of texts (Echtheitskritik), 
- help to judge the plausibility of conjectures and readings (textual criticism), 
- provide important information for the stylistic design of texts or 
particular text passages (interpretation). 

Nevertheless, a history of hiatus in ancient prose has not been written yet. Therefore, my project aims at writing this 
history while this website serves the purpose of visualizing the relevant data and fostering discussions about the 
subject.

|II | nearly complete hiatus avoidance |   1-5 % |
|III | highly significant hiatus avoidance |   6-15 % |
|IV | significant hiatus avoidance |  16-25 %|
